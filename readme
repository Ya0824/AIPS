## Overview

This repository uses the **AES circuit** as a representative example to demonstrate the complete AIPS workflow.

These components correspond to the three major stages of the AIPS pipeline:

- **Data Preparation**
- **Diffusion Model**
- **Security Evaluation**

> **Note:**  
> Please preserve the directory structure provided in this repository, as the scripts assume fixed relative paths between different components.
